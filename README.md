# bug-search

Simple bug-search API using Elasticsearch to store bugs. Would be useful as a middleware to help limit duplicate bugs.

### Tech

* [ElasticSearch] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Flask] - awesome web-based text editor

### Installation

You need docker-compose

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Docker, N|Solid and NGINX

More details coming soon.

#### docker-compose.yml

Think it all should just work....
You can edit projects in the BugSearch/configs/Dockerconfig

### Todos

 - Add nginx to serve app
